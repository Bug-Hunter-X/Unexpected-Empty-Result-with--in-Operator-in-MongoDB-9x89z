# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when using an empty array.  The query unexpectedly returns no results, even when the field is not required.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when using the `$in` operator with an empty array. This should ideally match all documents, as an empty array implies no specific values to match against.  However, in practice, it returns no documents.

## Solution

The solution lies in checking for the empty array before executing the query or modifying the query logic to handle this condition appropriately.  The provided solution demonstrates an alternative approach that gives the expected result.
